OpenGL start up project

Last Updated (4/24/16)

This is meant to be a simple start up project for those interested in quickly diving into an OpenGL
environment to create OpenGL rendered applications.

This project is meant to be compatible with any OS.
This has currently been tested to work properly with...
Windows 10
OS X El Capitan

YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR OWN EXTERNAL LIBRARIES
   The libraries used so far are...
	- glfw
	- glew
	- SOIL (will be used for textures, but not in use right now) 

This is still a work in progress. More to come...
